# HD-Movienet

HD-Movienet enables accelerated 3D radial k-space acquisition for motion-resolved 4D MRI of the lungs. It achieves an isotropic resolution of 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 mm³, with scan times of 2 minutes for anatomical imaging at both expiration and inspiration, encompassing 4 respiratory phases.

This file is for a 3D HD-Movienet model state dictionary for 4 motion states.
